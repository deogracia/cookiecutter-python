How to set up your development environment
------------------------------------------

You need Python 3.6+ and the following tools:

- Pyenv_
- Poetry_

Install the needed python version by looking in the .python-version file

.. code:: console

  $ cat .python-version
  # 3.7.11
  # 3.8.11
  # 3.9.6
  # 3.6.14
  $ pyenv install 3.7.11
  $ pyenv install 3.8.11
  $ pyenv install 3.9.6
  $ pyenv install 3.6.14

Install the package with development requirements:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry install

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run python
   $ poetry run {{cookiecutter.project_name}}

.. _Pyenv: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv
.. _Poetry: https://python-poetry.org/


How to test the project
-----------------------

Run the full test suite:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run nox

List the available Nox sessions:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run nox --list-sessions

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run nox --session=tests

Unit tests are located in the ``tests`` directory,
and are written using the pytest_ testing framework.
